# The Eternal Return of Tech Panic: When Innovation Becomes the Boogeyman - Part 1

The year is 1954. Parents across America are burning comic books in public gatherings while psychiatrist Fredric Wertham testifies before Congress that Batman and Robin have "homoerotic overtones" and Wonder Woman threatens to turn girls into lesbians. The comic book industry—which had been reaching millions of readers weekly—collapses. Publishers flee. Cartoonists lose their livelihoods. A strict censorship code emerges that will last for decades.

Sound familiar?

Fast forward seventy years, and we're watching the same performance with different props. The villain has a new name—Artificial Intelligence—but the script remains remarkably unchanged. The moral panic, the calls for regulation, the individual shaming, the predictions of societal collapse: it's all there, beat for beat, scene for scene.

### The Panic Cycle: A History of Manufactured Outrage

Here's what nobody tells you about technology moral panics: it's almost never about the technology. And it never has been.

In the 1700s, European elites diagnosed a terrifying new affliction spreading among young people: _Lesewut_—reading rage. Novels, they warned, led to "sensation-seeking and morally dissolute behavior." The novel _The Sorrows of Young Werther_ was blamed for a wave of suicides. Medical journals rang alarm bells. Concerned citizens warned that excessive reading would corrupt the youth, destroy their morals, rot their brains.

Yes, you read that correctly. People once had a moral panic about _reading too much_.

By the 1940s, Dr. Mary Preston was publishing in the _Journal of Pediatrics_ that three-quarters of children were "addicted" to radio and movies, which she claimed left "scar tissue in the form of hardness, an intense selfishness, even mercilessness" in young minds. The prescription? Strict limits on exposure to these corrupting influences.

The 1950s brought the television panic. Edward R. Murrow, in his famous "Wires and Lights in a Box" speech, warned that TV was being used to "distract, delude, amuse and insulate us." Critics predicted the death of reading, the collapse of community, shortened attention spans, the rise of violence. The term "couch potato" was born as a slur.

Except, in 1955, before television had reached most American homes, only 39% of Americans reported reading even _one book_ that year. The "death of reading" had already happened, at least according to the metrics. Television didn't kill reading. But it made a convenient scapegoat for broader social anxieties about education, culture, and social progress.

The 1980s gave us the Satanic Panic over Dungeons & Dragons. The 1990s brought us violent video games corrupting youth (they didn't—crime actually declined during peak gaming adoption-although you wouldn't think so if you watched most network news). The 2000s? The dark, evil corners of the World Wide Web (they existed sure, but not nearly at the scale we were made to believe). The 2010s have been about social media destroying attention spans and causing teen suicide (okay, maybe this one is a little true).

And now? It's AI is "scary, creepy, evil, and ruining everything."

### What Really Gets Erased in These Panics

But here's what makes these moral panics particularly insidious: they don't just target technologies—they erase the people those technologies help.

When critics were busy warning that comic books would destroy children's minds, they conveniently forgot about the kids who couldn't afford books but could trade comics. When elites panicked about radio corrupting youth, they ignored the blind veterans who finally had access to news and entertainment through talking programs. When television became the enemy, nobody acknowledged the children with learning differences who could finally engage with stories through visual media.

And when everyone was mourning the "death of books" caused by audiobooks? They erased the student with dyslexia who could finally participate in class discussions about literature. The child with visual impairment who discovered Harry Potter through narration. The person with ADHD who found that audiobooks let them finally finish a novel without re-reading the same page fifteen times.

The National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled was established in 1931—nearly a century ago—specifically to provide "talking books" to people who couldn't access print. Audiobooks weren't invented to make reading "easier" for lazy people. They were invented as assistive technology, as accessibility infrastructure, as a civil right.

But in every tech panic, the accessibility dimension vanishes. Because acknowledging it would complicate the narrative. It would force us to admit that what some call "cheating" others call "essential access." That what some view as "cognitive shortcuts" others experience as "the only way I can participate."

### The Pattern That Never Changes

Every technology moral panic follows the same predictable arc:

**Stage 1: The Innovation** - A new technology emerges that changes how people access information or entertainment.

**Stage 2: The Panic** - Elites and gatekeepers sound alarms about cognitive decline, moral degradation, or social collapse.

**Stage 3: The Shaming** - Individual users are blamed for society's ills. The focus shifts from systems to personal responsibility.

**Stage 4: The Selective Amnesia** - The people who benefit most from the technology—often those with disabilities, from marginalized communities, or with fewer resources—are erased from the conversation.

**Stage 5: The Normalization** - Eventually, the panic fades. The technology becomes integrated into daily life. A new innovation arrives, and the cycle begins again.

We're currently somewhere between Stages 3 and 4 with AI. The technology has arrived. The panic is in full swing. Individual users are being shamed for their ChatGPT queries. And once again, the people who most need these tools are disappearing from the discourse.

### Tomorrow's Villains, Yesterday's Heroes

Here's the uncomfortable truth: every technology we now consider essential was once the boogeyman. The printing press would destroy memory and learning. The telephone would destroy face-to-face conversation. The calculator would destroy mathematical thinking. The internet would destroy critical thinking.

And you know what? In some narrow, specific ways, each of these predictions contained a grain of truth. The printing press _did_ change how people used memory. The calculator _did_ change how people learned arithmetic. The internet _did_ change how people research and verify information.

But that's not the same as "destroying" anything. It's called _adaptation_. It's called _evolution_. It's what humans have always done with new tools.

The question was never "Will this technology change things?" Of course it will. The question is: "Who benefits from the change, and who gets left behind?"

And here's where the moral panic does its real damage: by focusing all our outrage on individual use and personal shame, we completely miss the structural question. We waste our energy yelling at people for using ChatGPT instead of asking: "How do we ensure AI serves justice rather than amplifying inequality?"

### What the Panic Prevents Us From Seeing

When we're busy shaming each other for using AI, we're not paying attention to:

- Which communities are excluded from AI development and whose voices shape these tools
- How AI training data reflects and amplifies existing biases
- Whether the benefits of AI reach beyond well-resourced institutions
- How AI affects the balance of power in knowledge creation and validation
- What regulatory frameworks might ensure equitable access and ethical deployment

The moral panic makes us look at individuals when we should be examining systems. It makes us focus on use when we should be interrogating power. It makes us afraid of the tool when we should be questioning who controls it and for what purposes.

And most critically: it makes us forget about the people for whom these tools aren't optional conveniences but essential infrastructure for participation.
