- AI-Powered Summary: Employ an AI tool to generate a short summary or "gap analysis" highlighting the key issues related to digital health equity discussed in each post.
- Interactive Q&A: Offer a feature for users to pose questions related to the content, with answers provided by a generative AI that draws from the blog content.
- Free Access: Provide an open-source, freely available blog site without any subscriptions or membership requirements.
- Metro-Style Map UI: The user interface reflects the aesthetic and organization of the London Underground transit system. Metro-style map for tag and category display.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: '#E31B23', the recognizable red from the London Underground logo.
- Secondary color: '#003688', the dark blue from the London Underground logo, used for text and accents.
- Background color: '#FFFFFF', a clean white to provide contrast and readability.
- Body font: 'Roboto', a modern sans-serif font that ensures readability across devices.
- Headline font: 'Bebas Neue', a condensed sans-serif for headings, echoing the Underground's signage.
- Use a set of custom icons inspired by the London Underground map, representing categories and tags.
- Implement a grid-based layout with clear lines and generous whitespace, reminiscent of the Underground map's structure.
- Each node on the map corresponds to a tag or category. The lines reflect realtionships (hierarchical or otherwise) between them.
- Consider an interactive element in the main page, where the AI automatically draws a 'line' from one area of the metro-map to another.
